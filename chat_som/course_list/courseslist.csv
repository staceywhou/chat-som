PHD,PhD,"This course presents an introduction to asset pricing at the PhD level. The first half of the
course covers the theory of choice under uncertainty, then develops classical asset pricing
theory in discrete time, including the principle of no arbitrage, mean-variance analysis,
the CAPM, and factor models. The second half of the course will focus on the connection
between asset prices and macroeconomic quantities. After covering the main models
based on consumption data, we will move to production-based asset pricing and pricing
in the presence of various frictions. We will also cover optimal (short-run and especially
long-run) portfolio choice.
The course assumes knowledge of microeconomics and statistics at an advanced
undergraduate level, but does not require any prior knowledge of finance. It is aimed at

customer.” Through lectures and cases, we will illustrate how to create a customer
aligned company that responds to changes in the marketplace.
Course Objectives:
1. Introduce a framework for customer driven marketing analysis (customer
analysis, consumer behavior, segmentation, positioning and marketing mix design)
that help create and deliver a superior value proposition.
2. Introduce tools for analyzing customer behavior, managing customer
relationships, (e.g., customer lifetime value and customer activity-based costing)
and customer feedback (e.g., preference measurement, satisfaction and loyalty
measurement).
3. Introduce a framework for creating an organization aligned with customer
needs.
By the end of the course you should understand customer analysis, the creation
of a superior value proposition, and ways to organize the firm around strategic
objectives. Following the educational philosophy articulated below, we will focus

innumerable decisions, each of which represents an opportunity to take (or not take) actions that 
support the organization’s goals and objectives. How your employees act when confronted with these 
decisions will depend in part on who they are as individuals — their values, beliefs, and capabilities. It 
will also depend on various aspects of the context, such as rewards and incentives, and the degree of 
connection between your employees’ actions and outcomes they personally regard as meaningful. 
Finally, it will depend on their relationship with you as a manager — whether they accept your authority 
as legitimate, find you credible, and come to internalize your objectives and values as their own. In this 
course, we study how an organization can get the most out of its workforce. The focus of this course is 
on crafting and managing employment relationships in order to maximally align employees’ aspirations 
and capabilities with the organization’s needs. 
 
As organizations have become increasingly attuned to the potential competitive advantage derived from 
effective management of people, they have become more focused on evidence-based decision-making in 
the human resources arena, leveraging big data and analytic techniques in designing and evaluating their

GSE is committed to channeling the skills of Yale students to assist Indian organizations to expand their reach and impact on “base of the pyramid” communities. Yale students partner with mission-driven social entrepreneurs (SEs) to focus on a specific management challenge that the student/SE teams work together to address during the semester.  GSE has worked with more than 50 leading and emerging Indian social enterprises engaged in economic development, sustainable energy, women’s empowerment, education, environmental conservation, and affordable housing. The course covers both theoretical and practical issues, including case studies and discussions on social enterprise, developing a theory of change and related social metrics, financing social businesses, the role of civil society in India, framing a consulting engagement, managing team dynamics, etc. The course will be taught by Asha Ghosh, Lecturer at SOM and Urban Program Manager at YSE, in collaboration with Tony Sheldon, Senior Lecturer in the Practice of Management and Executive Director of SOM’s Program on Social Enterprise. The course meets on Wednesday afternoons 2:40 – 5:40 during Fall-2 and Spring-1. Students will travel to India to work on-site with their partner SEs, and for a convening of all the student/SE project teams, in mid- to late January 2024 for 10 days.

bid,Organizational Behavior,"Attendance is required for the first two classes to retain a place in the course or on the waiting list. Studies have shown that the average manager spends about two-thirds of their time interacting with others. It should be no surprise that skill in interpersonal relationships is one of the most frequent determinants of managerial success or failure. This course is designed to help students learn some of the skills necessary for successfully navigating and leading in the face of fast-paced, complex human interaction. The central focus is to increase students' ability to understand and diagnose interpersonal dynamics as well as to increase personal understanding of how they impact others.

This course is a memory-making, powerful and even transformational experience for many students. While readings and group exercises are used to begin discussion, the core learning material emerges in small group interaction. Students learn how they function in small groups and how they relate to others from feedback and reaction of other class members. As such, students planning to enroll should understand that the course methodologies are likely quite different than most courses you have taken to date. Much of the learning will emerge from a) personal reflection on interpersonal and group dynamics and b) the ability/willingness to learn interpersonally from experience, risk-taking, self-disclosure, and feedback.

The goal of Interpersonal and Group Dynamics is to learn, through experience in a small group setting, how:

•	To use interpersonal communication skills to influence and lead the building of more open, effective, and rewarding relationships, even with people whom you may initially experience as difficult.
•	To identify and pursue personal learning goals aimed at improving interpersonal communications.
•	To “learn how to learn” interpersonally via the continuous practice of risk taking, disclosure, and feedback in service of evolving learning goals.
•	To learn about group dynamics and your role in groups by observing and exploring conscious and unconscious assumptions, behaviors and feelings.

Personal knowledge and ability in these areas is crucial to becoming a more effective leader for business and society in today’s ever changing, complex, and highly interdependent organizations.

What are the pressures on that system including market, regulatory, political and social dynamics? What are the key challenges to that system? How can the system be strengthened? In this course we are defining the global financial system (GFS) as encompassing central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions such as asset managers and private equity firms, financial regulators and international organizations. Thus we will encompass subjects such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, Goldman Sachs and the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, the Carlyle Group and the BlackRock Investment Management Co., the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Financial Stability Board, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. We will take a broad view of the GFS including its history, its geopolitical framework, its economic foundations and its legal underpinnings. We will consider the GFS as a critical public good in the same way that clean air is a public good. We will look at a number of other key issues such as how the GFS deals with economic growth, economic and financial stability, distributional questions, employment issues, and long term investments in infrastructure. We will discuss how new technologies are affecting several of the biggest issues in global finance. We will examine the GFS as a large-scale complex network, thereby compelling us to see it in an interconnected and multidisciplinary way.

Sometimes, a chance of life or death is literally at stake: how and when should a leader decide to let some people die, or explicitly ask people to die to give others a chance to live? At other times, while life or death may not be at stake, a leader must still decide difficult issues: when to partner with unsavory characters, when to admit failure, when to release information or make choices transparent. The pandemic today makes clearer than ever the consequences of decisions in one community that can affect the entire world. This interdisciplinary seminar draws on perspectives from law, management, and public policy in exploring how leaders develop their principles, respond when their principles fail or conflict, and make real-world choices when, in fact, there are no good choices.

In this interdisciplinary clinic taught between the School of Architecture, School of Law, and School of Management, and organized by the Yale Urban Design Workshop, students will gain hands-on, practical experience in architectural and urban development and social entrepreneurship while contributing novel, concrete solutions to the housing affordability crisis in Connecticut.  Working in teams directly with local community-based non-profits, students will co-create detailed development proposals and architectural designs anchored by affordable housing, but which will also engage with a range of community development issues including environmental justice, sustainability, resilience, social equity, identity, food scarcity, mobility, and health.  Through seminars and workshops with Yale faculty and guest practitioners, students will be introduced to the history, theory, issues, and contemporary practices in the field, and will get direct feedback on their work.  

Offered in partnership with the Connecticut Department of Housing (DOH) as part of the Connecticut Plan for Healthy Cities, student projects will center on community wealth building and equitable economic recovery in some of Connecticut’s most economically distressed neighborhoods, by proposing multi-sector, place-based projects that focus on housing, health, and economic development.  Proposals will have the opportunity to receive funding from the State both towards the implementation of rapidly deployed pilot projects during the course period, as well as towards predevelopment activities for larger projects, such as housing rehabilitation or new building construction.  

Students in the course will be organized into multi-disciplinary teams including law, management, and architecture students, who will ideate together and take on specific team roles, modeling real-world project development teams. Teams will be assigned to work with non-profit developers tackling development or redevelopment projects that include affordable housing.  Facilities of the Yale Urban Design Workshop will be available to students of the course.  Students may have the opportunity to continue their leadership in these projects following the end of the course, in a professional capacity, as they move towards implementation.

MAM required,MAM,"One of the biggest problems in business today is short-termism. The same, incidentally, is true for politics. Quarterly earnings, the 24hr news cycle, and social media blips command much of if not most attention. Yet the opportunity set facing business is overwhelmingly shaped by broad macro-trends and systemic risks – call them “big issues.” Climate change, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and urbanization are just some of the trends that will make some industries rise while others fall; challenge managers to reinvent their companies, products, and even themselves; and provide exciting opportunities for global leaders who are change agents and entrepreneurs. 
At the same time, because of business’s ability to adapt to and even steer major change, many stakeholders are looking to the business community to help solve global problems. To meet stakeholder expectations, and to ultimately convert global challenges into business opportunities, aspiring leaders must understand an array of issues that extend far beyond traditional business concerns. Only then can they create ‘shared value’ at the nexus of business and society.

In this course, using a combined framework of the energy trilemma and an ever-narrowing focus on geopolitical, regional, and local issues, including matters such as resource nationalism and perceived global iniquities, CBAM and historical emission and growth patterns, are explored. At an energy-system level, the need for dispatchable electricity to maintain a constant frequency on the grid, additional storage, and grid strengthening are explored to illustrate the complexity of greening a fossil-dominated electricity system. At a social level, challenges with reskilling and upskilling coal value chain workers are considered, as well as the challenges of legacy assets, and the cost of decommissioning and rehabilitation. A South African JET project is considered to understand the challenges at national, regional, and grassroots levels; how incumbent value chains have legitimate concerns; and what ameliorative steps can be taken to ensure that the transition is as just as possible. The impacts on employment, public health, water consumption, and regional development are considered.

bid,Organizational Behavior,"Designed for individuals at any stage of their career, this course is meant to debunk the fallacies that we have about power and to explore the fundamentals of power in interpersonal relationships, in organizations, and in society. In doing so, we will lift the veil on power, revealing what it really is, and how it works, ultimately unleashing your potential to build and use power to effect change. It is meant for those who want to make things happen, despite the obstacles that might stand in the way. 

This course is also intended to prepare you to use power responsibly as well as to understand its corruptive perils, both for yourself and those around you. As such, it will equip you to challenge the status quo in order to address some of the most pressing social and environmental problems of our time, from fighting racism to reducing economic inequalities, saving the planet, and protecting democracy. 

The course introduces conceptual models, tactical approaches, and assessment tools to help you develop your own influence style and understand political dynamics as they unfold around you. By focusing on specific expressions of power and influence, this course will give you the opportunity to observe effective—and ineffective—uses of power in different contexts and stages of a person’s career. The subject matter will challenge you to define for yourself what constitutes the ethical exercise of power and influence in your life. The course builds on the book “Power, For All: How It Really Works and Why It’s Everyone’s Business” (Simon & Schuster, 2021), written by Julie Battilana and Tiziana Casciaro. Some of the chapters of the book will be assigned together with other readings throughout the course, but you do not need to have read the book (except for the introduction that will be an assigned reading for the first session) before the beginning of class.

Why does a Beeple NFT sell for a staggering $70M? Can auction houses and art fairs be replaced by new models after Covid-19?

bid,Real Estate,"This half semester course will provide an introduction to real estate development, investment, finance and strategy outside of the United States.  Global investment in financial assets, the need for risk diversification, the increased accuracy of property records, greater transparency, more relaxed laws permitting foreign investment, and population movement around the world—all of these trends have led to a tremendous increase in cross-border real estate investing for both private equity and public companies.  While many studies of international real estate focus on the role of foreign real property in the U. S. institutional portfolio, this course will take a wider and more historical view of the cultural attitudes towards real estate around the world and how they impact the quality and risk of investment assets.  Detailed analysis will begin with property level due diligence in order to provide a fundamental understanding of how and why property markets differ by country beyond simple supply/demand dynamics.  This course will consist of three parts:  a.) a micro-market analysis of real property characteristics in various countries around the world, including financing, leasing and valuation; b.) an analysis of investment vehicles—public and private—available to institutional investors, as well as cross-border transactions, and c.) a macro-market view of world space and capital  markets, the rationale for international investing, trends in capital flows and portfolio composition and the various ways in which risk is measured and mitigated.  Each part of the course will require a brief individual assignment completed over a two-week period.  The first research project will be a study of a significant real property asset outside of the United States, including its market, ownership, legal structure, valuation, and transaction history.  Both the G-8 and G-20 nations will be the object of study, but individual students are free to concentrate on any country of interest.  The second research project will consist of an analysis of a private equity or publicly-traded foreign property company, its current fair value, competitive advantage and future prospects.  An interview with a top executive of a company will be encouraged and facilitated.  The third research project will consist of a comparative analysis of world property markets and the hypothetical investment in a portfolio of real estate assets across three or more foreign property markets.  The course will consist of lectures, discussion, case studies and readings on international real estate from a variety of sources.

permission,GNAM,"We are in a period of unprecedented technological change - disruptive technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, and big data are already changing how businesses operate, strategize and communicate. As more organizations digitize their processes with these technologies, they are realizing that operating reliable digital services and safeguarding sensitive data are essential to establishing trust with customers and maintaining business continuity.

Any organisation that relies on computer networks, digital information, and the Internet is vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Sabotage, hacking, even uncontrolled use of social media: all these can lead to financial loss, disruption of operations, and, inevitably, reputational damage. The threats are real, and they are changing all the time. Managing these threats is not the sole responsibility of the IT department, it is business leaders’ job to understand and oversee organisations’ response to cyber/digital threats and attacks.

With an ever-increasing number of security breaches and privacy incidents under the spotlight, consumers’ awareness about privacy is also becoming significantly higher. Consumers are starting to act based on how well they believe their privacy is protected by the organizations collecting and processing their personal information. Thus, customer trust is becoming the most important asset of companies doing digital business. The challenge is not only the security incidents or customer expectations, but also the changing regulations. As an example, the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is effective since May 2018, imposing stricter rules to companies handling personal data. Organizations that fail to provide secure means of data collection and analysis will be facing high fines. Compliance with any data protection regulation affects every department and require input from CMOs, CEOs, and boards, in addition to cyber security teams.

Considering the above-mentioned trends, the objective of this course is to introduce the participants to the fifth dimension of warfare: the cyber arena. This course will help participants build awareness about cyber threats they are likely to experience, the data security & protection compliance challenges they will face, the operational as well as ethical dilemmas they will need to address, and, crucially, what actions to take in case of cyber incident.",22207,MGT 953,fall,20231116 000000.000,20231005 000000.000,GNAM: Digital Resilience,elective,Th 8:30 AM-11:30 AM,"Isik, Öykü",,https://event-reg.som.yale.edu/signup/DigResilience,EVANS ,1,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/91386/assignments/syllabus,202303,2,1,,,

By introducing you to Service Management, an emerging field of management science which was originally developed out of the research on the services industries but has later evolved into the study on the logic (or lens, if you will) of value creation and value capture across industries, this course attempts to help future business leaders to see ongoing fundamental shift in management logic and to seize opportunities and challenges involved in leading business in such an exciting time.",22211,MGT 977,fall-2,20231218 000000.000,20231109 000000.000,GNAM: Service Management,elective,M   Th 5:00 PM-7:00 PM,"Fujikawa, Yoshinori",yoshinori.fujikawa@yale.edu,https://event-reg.som.yale.edu/signup/Service2023,EVANS ,1,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/91390/assignments/syllabus,202303,2,1,,,

permission,GNAM,"During the last 10 years, financial investors have gained power and influence within the global sports industry. In North America, several clubs have owners with a private equity background and within European football, many clubs are owned by financial investors, private equity companies or listed on the stock exchange.

However, despite this increased financialization, there are strong counter forces. Many sport clubs are driven by passionate interests where supporters want to maintain historical community identities and there are also public organizations on both state and city levels that have highlighted the risks of too much financialization. This tension between financial investments and passionate interests is at the core of this course. The recent failure of the European Super League project demonstrates that this is one of the most strategic issues within the global football community. We also see how the tensions between financial investments and passionate interests are discussed in relation to Olympic Games and other large sport events.",22213,MGT 981,fall-2,20240117 000000.000,20231025 000000.000,GNAM Investments and Value Creation in Global Sports,elective,M  W F 9:00 AM-11:00 AM,"Carlsson-Wall, Martin",,https://event-reg.som.yale.edu/signup/Sports2023,EVANS ,1,https://yale.instructure.com/courses/91393/assignments/syllabus,202303,4,1,,,
permission,Political Science,"This two-term course begins in January with readings in classical works from Sun Tzu to Clausewitz to Kissinger. Students identify principles of strategy and examine the extent to which these were or were not applied in historical case studies from the Peloponnesian War to the post-Cold War period. During the summer students undertake research projects or internships designed to apply resulting insights to the detailed analysis of a particular strategic problem or aspect of strategy. Written reports are presented and critically examined early in the fall term. Students must take both terms, fulfill the summer research/internship, and attend additional lectures to be scheduled throughout the spring and fall terms. Admission is by competitive application only; forms are available at International Security Studies (http://www.yale.edu/iss/).  Applications are usually due by November 1.
