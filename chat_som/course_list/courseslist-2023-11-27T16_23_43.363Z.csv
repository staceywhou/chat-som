"PHD","PhD","Empirical seminar taught alternate years. Study of different areas of empirical research within the financial accounting literature.  The goal is to introduce the types of questions asked in these areas, to think about how these questions may relate to each other and to questions in other disciplines, and to get you to think about issues you may want to research. The objective is to help you identify interesting, important, and researchable topics related to empirical financial accounting.","29690","MGMT 704","spring","","","Seminar In Accounting Rsrch IV","PHD","F 1:15 PM-4:15 PM","Thomas, Jake","jacob.thomas@yale.edu","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/75241/assignments/syllabus","EVANS 2230","01","","202401","1.0","1","1:15 PM","4:15 PM","Fr"

"bid","GSR","Spain has experienced a remarkable societal and economic transformation since the death of dictator Francisco Franco and the subsequent advent of democracy in the late 1970s. Nowadays Spain is a modern and decidedly European economy placed 15th in the world by GDP and 4th in the European Union. Its historical ties make it a vibrant economy acting as a bridge between the European Union and Latin America. It features a rich cultural diversity that is exemplified by the coexistence of five official languages and large immigrant populations from Latin America, Africa, and Asia.

It is a country of large swings and contrast. It went from being a reactionary dictatorship in the 1970s to an open and progressive society, third in the world to legalize same-sex marriage. Traditionally a country of emigrants, in the year 2000 only 2% of the Spanish population was foreign-born; following a transformational immigration boom, by 2009 the fraction of immigrants had reached 12% and is nowadays at 17%. The meteoric economic growth Spain experienced in the early 2000s was halted by one of the biggest crashes experienced by any country during the Global Financial Crisis and the European debt crisis, but Spain has continued to be one of the growth engines of Europe.

This IE will expose you to business, policymaking, and society in Spain. Over the course of ten days, we will meet with business and policy leaders in Madrid, Barcelona, and (to-be-confirmed) Andalucía, moving between cities using Spain’s world-leading high-speed train network. You will learn about and meet the business which have placed Spain on the map, especially in banking, infrastructure, digital infrastructure, and energy. We will also analyze the links between the public and private sector in strategic industries, and entrepreneurship in Spain. Throughout the trip you will be immersed in Spain’s history and culture including Gaudi’s Barcelona, flamenco art, traditional and new cuisine, and world-renowned soccer.

The course and trip will be led by Professor Jaime Arellano-Bover, who is originally from Madrid. The TA for the course, Pablo Polzer, is from San Sebastian, Spain and has entrepreneurial experience in the country.

Part of the goal of such a course is to be an example of what going to a different country for work would be like—and how to prepare for it. How work itself is carried out in Norway does not differ much from the US. Startup incubators often are funky open spaces with a foosball table close to the entrance. Factory assembly lines in Norway look like... assembly lines. And negotiations are mostly structured similarly to what you would experience in the US.

"bid","Organizational Behavior","Priority Given to Those Who Completed MGT 531 Interpersonal Dynamics. The world of work is rapidly changing. Compared to a past in which managers and leaders mostly focused on managing systems and transferring information, everyday leadership demands have broadened and escalated to include managing complexity across many domains. Effective everyday leadership often requires dynamic capacity outside of the subject matter experience in order to manage group dynamics and unleash potential for others under conditions of ambiguity, high pace and uncertainty. 
This course is designed to deepen effectiveness and capacity in the ways we lead and interact everyday. Using a similar pedagogy to the popular and transformational Interpersonal and Group Dynamics (IPD) course, this course builds on the skills and practices acquired in that context.  While IPD focuses on the intensive lab experience as a practicum, the Everyday Leadership course focuses on employing a similar set of skills in your everyday context.
With the assertion that the way we lead and interact has impact everyday, we will pay attention to how we co-create lived experience through moments of impact. This course is designed to help you better understand and take responsibility for your impact, as well as strive to align your impact with your intentions via everyday actions and micro-moments. We will pay attention to self-leadership as well impacting teams, organizational culture and building collective leadership capacity.
This course will integrate horizontal (skill) and vertical (capacity) development. Horizontal learning includes the skill of identifying and pursuing everyday leadership learning goals; developing presence; building leadership perspective and mindset; unleashing potential via feedback, coaching and psychological safety; aligning values with impact, managing conflict, connecting. Vertical development deepens the capacity to enact horizontal skills with compassion, empathy, humor, wisdom, perspective and grace.
It is important to note that this course's learning process is different from most academic classrooms. The process is more akin to the way adults learn leadership in the course of life and work. In this way, the course is structured around experiential and reflective learning modes, including collaborative reflection. In other words, you will be asked to engage through a combination of: interacting with scholarship, reflecting on your own experience, and trying out new practices and skills . You will be part of a learning group designed to promote collaborative developmental learning - an experience and skill we all need in organizations today which demand ongoing learning and change capacity.

"bid","Economics","Many classes in business school examine the market determinants of interactions between firms and between firms and consumers. In this class, we will study how social identities and interactions shape and respond to the behavior of market participants. For example, managers’ biases may affect the hiring, evaluation, and promotion of gender, racial, or religious minorities, which in turn may in turn affect the viability of the firm in the long run. Similarly, peer interactions within the firm and incentives for collaboration with or competition between team members may affect employees’ productivity and job satisfaction. To succeed, managers must navigate the social environment of the firm just as they do the market environment.

This class offers a research-driven perspective on the economics of the firm in the social world. Class sessions are a mixture of lectures and student presentations of existing research. Assessment will be based on class participation, in-class presentations, two assignments, and a final project. Students should expect to read, discuss, and present research papers, and to debate firm and public policy choices. The course material draws primarily on contemporary work in labor and personnel economics.

The first half of the course focuses on race and gender in the labor market. We will consider present and past differences in career and well-being outcomes by race and gender, and how deliberate discrimination and profit maximizing behavior can contribute to or mitigate these gaps. We will discuss specific management practices related to hiring, evaluation, promotion, and task structure that mediate cross-group differences, as well as how firms and workers respond to policy interventions in these processes, such as board quotas and restrictions on the information that can be used in hiring. Our goal is to develop a theoretical and empirical understanding of the economics of cross-group differences in labor market outcomes, and to highlight the limitations of existing approaches where applicable.

The second half of the course focuses on teamwork, competition, and social networks in the labor market. We first consider topics related to team production, such as how managers build productive teams in settings where individual workers compete for promotions, and how inequality and pay transparency within the firm affect job satisfaction and productivity. We then turn to the analysis of networks in the context of hiring and on-the-job performance, with the goal of understanding when, why, and how network ties are valuable for firms and workers. We will combine the theory of personnel economics with applications ranging from pay equity at factories in rural India to mutual fund managers with educational ties to members of corporate boards.","28778","MGT 528","spring-1","20240305 000000.000","20240122 000000.000","The Firm in the Social World","elective","M  W 1:00 PM-2:20 PM","Zimmerman, Seth","seth.zimmerman@yale.edu","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/85538/assignments/syllabus","EVANS 4400","01","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94577/assignments/syllabus","202401","2.0","1","","",""
"No","Entrepreneurship & Private Equity","Launched in 2008 at the Yale School of Management, the Global Social Entrepreneurship (GSE) India course links teams of Yale students with social enterprises based in India. GSE is committed to channeling the skills of Yale students to assist Indian organizations to expand their reach and impact on “base of the pyramid” communities. Yale students partner with mission-driven social entrepreneurs (SEs) to focus on a specific management challenge that the student/SE teams work together to address during the semester.  GSE has worked with more than 50 leading and emerging Indian social enterprises engaged in economic development, sustainable energy, women’s empowerment, education, environmental conservation, and affordable housing. The course covers both theoretical and practical issues, including case studies and discussions on social enterprise, developing a theory of change and related social metrics, financing social businesses, the role of civil society in India, framing a consulting engagement, managing team dynamics, etc. The course will be taught by Asha Ghosh, Lecturer at SOM and Urban Program Manager at YSE, in collaboration with Tony Sheldon, Senior Lecturer in the Practice of Management and Executive Director of SOM’s Program on Social Enterprise. The course meets on Wednesday afternoons 2:40 – 5:40 during Fall-2 and Spring-1. Students will travel to India to work on-site with their partner SEs, and for a convening of all the student/SE project teams, in mid- to late January 2024 for 10 days. As with the International Experience and the Global Network Immersion Week, students will be responsible for covering the costs of their round-trip airfare to India and related expenses (such as visa and immunizations). SOM students can draw on their available GSA days to offset in-country travel, hotel, and related costs. GSE has arrangements with Jackson and YSE to cover in-country costs for their students. Enrollment is by application only. Students accepted and enrolled in GSE will allocate 150 of their fall course bidding points towards the course. This is considered a 6 unit course that spans fall-2 and spring-1. It may not be taken as a half semester course. 2 units are applied in fall-2 and 4 units applied in spring-1.

Those who miss the first day of class will be dropped from enrollment.This course takes a comprehensive view of the value-adding impact of top corporate leaders and how they revolutionize their enterprises, their industries, and the world economy. The subject matter will embrace and integrate such broad key dimensions of strategic change as economic context, shifting markets, emerging technologies, corporate life stage, company culture, and corporate governance together with the character, skill-set, and life stages of individual leaders. 
  
 The course mission involves three equally important goals. The first is to help students anticipate the multi-dimensional cross-disciplinary aspects of successful planned change from strategic systems to group dynamics and individual psychology. A second is to appreciate the consequences of the unintended effects of strategic change initiatives on work communities and societies at-large. The last is to provide students with an overview of the contemporary industry-specific challenges in an effort to highlight the varied leadership values and skills that are not always apparent as corporations make acquisitions or managers select careers. The course materials used to fulfill this mission require students to be comfortable with a wide variety of learning tools including: research articles; case studies; current industry periodicals; spirited class discussion; role playing; video; and frequent prominent industry leaders as class visitors. 
 
 
 
 Following an overview that builds an analytic framework for the course, the key dimensions of strategic change will be examined through a sequence of industry-by-industry settings including: professional services; financial services; retail; e-commerce; communications and media; recreation and travel; government and nonprofit; industrial and consumer products. Toward the close, the course will return to cross-industry change leadership and challenges such as executive succession, life stage imperatives, and ethical dilemmas.

"bid","Strategy","Trust in science among the public is at a recent-historic low, and there are powerful forces working to keep it that way. If experts do not actively engage in the information landscape, their work risks being undone or lost. If they interact in the wrong ways, they could end up only contributing more to the chaos and division that currently characterize the information landscape. Opting out is not an option; we all have public faces now, and the question is how best to develop and utilize them. Given the state of division and distrust that threaten science, it should likely be among the aspirations of every graduate with an interest in healthcare management, science, medicine, and/or public health to have some part in shaping narratives that promote health and fact-based discourse over angry, divisive stagnation. This course invites students to study ways in which it can be done, and to reflect on their own potential, and to try out different techniques and different platforms—to begin to find their public voice. To see what works for some messages and some communicators, and what fails, and why. 
 
 The course will introduce and study the increasingly broad array of tools to engage in public discourse, to reach people outside of their immediate circles of professional contacts, and to influence the lives of many. It is predicated on the idea that science cannot be conceived as a system by which knowledge emanates outward (much less downward) from academia, or it will cease to reach people and to affect the world, but only exacerbate distrust and claims of elitism. Rather science can only exist as an active process of communication between researchers and the public. This is how trust is built and the learning process is most effective, as a mutual, shared endeavor. This is a widely held conception of science, and yet the actual methods of such engagement are overlooked or ignored by many in the health sciences. 
 
 This course is not prescriptive, but is meant to engage critically with modes of communication and shaping discourse. The course will equip students to critically analyze emerging methods of health-oriented communication. It will offer a survey of many approaches wherein students will develop an understanding of the canonical paths to writing for large audiences (op-eds, long-form journalism)—as well as explore how narratives emerge over time in much smaller and more personal scales. We will study the role that experts play in creating media on their own platforms and by working with media outlets as either sources or contributors, consultants or editors or publishers.  It is critical that not all experts communicate in the same styles and on the same platforms. Writing an op-ed in The New York Times is valuable, for example, but the ability to do that is just one tool in what needs to be an arsenal of ways of reaching people across cultural, socioeconomic, ideological, intellectual, and educational backgrounds.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""","28846","MGT 668","spring-2","20240507 000000.000","20240325 000000.000","Narratives in Health Media","elective","W 4:10 PM-7:10 PM","Hamblin, James","james.hamblin@yale.edu","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/85572/assignments/syllabus","EVANS 4410","01","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94579/assignments/syllabus","202401","2.0","1","","",""

If you do not enjoy contributing in class, this might not be the right course for you.  This course will use and apply various valuation techniques and financial analysis.  The course will not use class time to teach valuation or financial analysis.  While it is not a prerequisite, a basic understanding of valuation and financial analysis is helpful.  If you need additional help with valuation or financial analysis, please see the TAs and Instructor for support which can be provided outside of class.  The purpose of this course is to provide students with an opportunity to explore rollups, consolidations and serial acquisitions as a growth and value creation strategy in an entrepreneurial context.  Consolidations have been pursued in manufacturing and services businesses since the mid 1800s when oil and railroad trusts existed.  More recently, consolidations have existed in death care services, uniform rental services, manufacturing, food services and financial services.  The focus will be on the nature of serial acquisitions as compared to episodic, transformational transactions.  This course will explore why this strategy is so compelling to managers and investors.  The course instructor completed 38 acquisitions in the records management industry as the CEO of ArchivesOne and 22 acquisitions in the bottleless water industry as the CEO of Onesource Water.

The course seeks to provide students with an introduction to the range of sustainability issues and challenges that companies face in today’s fast-changing marketplace. It will introduce key corporate sustainability terms, concepts, tools, strategies, and frameworks based on the overarching theory that the traditional profit-maximizing mission of business (often called shareholder primacy) is giving way to a new vision of stakeholder responsibility that still seeks to provide good returns to the enterprise’s owners but also acknowledges obligations to employees, suppliers, customers, communities, and society more broadly.

"bid","Finance","This course will examine strategies used by middle market private equity firms to create value in portfolio companies, explore how the alignment of the PE firm’s mission, vision and values relate to its strategic choices in individual investments, and relate value creations strategies to the objectives of limited partners in making private equity investments. 
 
 The course takes a stakeholder approach to understanding private equity investing as a business: institutional limited partners typically make a private equity allocation of their portfolio in order to meet long term objectives – whether creating an endowment to support a charitable or educational institution, or to build wealth for an individual or family. The goals and risk tolerance of that institution govern the size and nature of allocations to PE funds – both the overall scale of the commitment, and the types of funds it selects. PE funds present track records, strategies, and organizational resumes to attract limited partners, but execute long term contracts giving them broad discretion to draw capital and implement their strategies. They then try to execute on their articulated strategies, motivated both by the economic incentives in those contracts, and the desire to build an institution that will continue to attract capital. Through a series of case studies we look at how PE executives make decisions at portfolio companies as they react to this framework.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

"bid","MMS GBS","The primary goal of this course is to furnish students with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively lead, manage, and function within teams that are both global and virtual in nature. The pandemic has instigated a significant shift in the way we work, changes that are likely to persist. Despite the potential advantages virtual work offers, managing virtual teams presents unique challenges. These challenges are even more pronounced in global virtual teams (GVTs) where cultural differences, time zone variations, and a multitude of other issues can arise, thereby hindering team effectiveness. 

This course builds upon the foundations of managing organizations, groups, and teams by adopting an action learning approach—providing opportunities to apply knowledge and skills in practice. You’ll participate in a series of exercises that simulate the issues faced by global virtual teams – sometimes emphasizing the “global” aspect, sometimes the “virtual”, and often both.

The course is structured into three modules:
•	MODULE 1 | GVT Class Sessions | 16:10-18:10, Mondays and Wednesdays, January 22, 24, 29, 31, and February 5, 2024 | Building on the concepts and frameworks introduced earlier in the curriculum, these exercise/simulation-based sessions aim to help you extend your knowledge on building, managing, and leading effective teams in global and virtual settings.
•	MODULE 2 | GVT Negotiation Exercise | February 2 – February 28, 2024 | Jointly run with 10+ GNAM partner schools, this module places you into an GVT, comprising students from different schools around the world. You will complete an interactive learning exercise involving team-building, coordination, decision-making, and cross-team analysis. This assignment offers real-time, hands-on practice in implementing the lessons from Module 1 of this course.
•	MODULE 3 | GVT Debrief Workshop | 16:10-18:10, Monday, March 4, 2024 | We will reconvene one final time to share your experiences and learnings from the GVT Negotiation Exercise.","28860","MGT 818","spring-1","20240305 000000.000","20240122 000000.000","Global Virtual Teams","MMS GBS","M  W 4:10 PM-6:10 PM","Fujikawa, Yoshinori","yoshinori.fujikawa@yale.edu","","EVANS 2410","G1","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94646/assignments/syllabus","202401","2.0","1","","",""

Our objective is to help you learn about and come to appreciate basic features of the creative process, including creative development and a number of different psychological and cultural approaches to creativity, as well as issues involved in managing creativity effectively, including leadership, managing creative people, teams and projects, creativity initiatives, and organizational response to change. How do creative ideas happen? How can we foster our creativity and the creativity of those around us? What are the paths of creative development of individuals who are successful in their creative endeavors? What are the obstacles to creativity? What is the nature of creativity in teams and organizations? These are some of the questions we will address.  We study creativity in many domains, including business, science and technology, the arts, and life in general, relying on a mixture of lectures, readings, and discussion. We engage in a variety of exercises, including exercises in which you will explore your own creativity and group exercises in which you engage in creative activity with others. We also learn through cases, about creativity in business and how organizations foster creativity and manage creative processes. Creativity is fascinating and incredibly important for society, and hopefully you will gain a greater and greater appreciation for this in the course of our work and later as you reflect back upon our work and continue to learn about creativity, on the job and in your life.","28845","MGT 828","spring-2","20240507 000000.000","20240325 000000.000","Creativity & Innovation","elective","W 2:40 PM-5:40 PM","Feinstein, Jonathan","jonathan.feinstein@yale.edu","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/85593/assignments/syllabus","EVANS 4230","01","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94673/assignments/syllabus","202401","2.0","1","","",""

The goal of the course is to teach you a set of conceptual tools that are useful for understanding what determines international trade and foreign investments. We will first review international trade theories that try to explain: Why do countries trade with each other? Do countries gain from trade? Who are the winners and losers? What goods should countries import and export? Can existing trade theories explain the rapid growth of China? Second, we will focus on foreign direct investment, multinational firms, and business opportunities in developing countries. For instance, we will explore what are the benefits and costs of hosting multinational companies in the developing world, both in the short- and long-run (in terms of productivity, living standards, culture, environmental effects). Third, we will analyze the role of trade policy. We will try to learn what are the trade and welfare effects of trade policy. This part of the course will review recent research that evaluates the effects of the trade war between China and the U.S. The course is self-contained.

"bid","Business & the Environment","Is Green the new Gold?  At least in renewable energy, the last 35 years have seen booms followed by spectacular busts.  While the recent collapse of several renewable energy companies--including the much publicized Solyndra--may suggest that this cycle is not much different than the last, many entrepreneurs are still forming green companies.  In addition, the ranks of climate change skeptics grows ever thinner in spite of the increase in political partisanship around climate change and renewable energy.
 This course will explore how investing in renewable energy is different than in investing in more prosaic sectors.  These differences include capital intensity, commodity markets, mature industry structure, local and federal regulation, and market imperfections.  The course will also review the differences in policy support given to renewable energy in other countries.  While the emphasis is on renewable energy, many of the same issues obtain in considering other green technologies—from water to new packaging.  The course will rely on real-life case studies to illustrate themes and to expose students to different end markets and to companies along the maturity cycle from early stage ventures to projects using mature technology.  In so doing, the course will give some insights as to specialized participants --VC, Private Equity, and Project Finance—fit together in funding a company.  Students should expect to leave the class better prepared to address major issues and seize new opportunities in clean energy finance. 
 While the course will use the lens of an investor, most of the issues are the same from the standpoint of a business owner seeking to finance renewable energy activities and a policy maker seeking to encourage capital formation in the sector.  Non-SOM students who have background in finance and in business strategy are encouraged and welcome to participate with permission of the instructor.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""","28876","MGT 842","spring-2","20240507 000000.000","20240325 000000.000","Financing Green Technologies","elective","W 2:40 PM-5:40 PM","Kauffman, Richard","richard.kauffman@yale.edu","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/85602/assignments/syllabus","EVANS 2410","01","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94724/assignments/syllabus","202401","2.0","1","","",""

"bid","Economics","In this class, we will attempt to reunite the disciplines of psychology and economics, which began drifting apart about a century ago.

"bid","Ethical Business Management","Business leaders today face more questions than ever about their companies’ stances on diversity and inclusion and their role in improving it. Black and white professionals alike are re-assessing the habits and rituals in their companies that hold them back from making inclusive products and creating inclusive workplaces. Companies are reckoning with, and in many cases apologizing for, their roles in past injustices. Business leaders are pondering whether they speak out about social issues like voting rights and re-evaluating their marketing of products. Entrepreneurs are finding new opportunities to serve Black, Latino and other underserved populations in some industries. Venture capitalists are increasing the amounts they dedicate to minority-owned businesses. And amidst all this, policymakers are questioning assumptions in government policies that contribute to inequities and taking actions -- like changing laws around race -  that will affect decision-making at companies.

This course explores the history of race and money in America, dating to the mid-1800s with a focus on Black Americans. The course ties past events to the present and challenges people to explore solutions that would move the needle in creating a more equitable society. The course will be relevant to managers in many industries including insurance, banking,  media, technology, education, real estate and more. In viewing the throughline of this history through today’s business lens, there will be many revelations along the way for both people who haven’t studied much history and for those who specialized in Black history. By the end of the course, students will have a clear picture of the economic gap that exists today between white Americans and people of color in many key areas like home ownership, debt, employment and education.","28889","MGT 861","spring-2","20240507 000000.000","20240325 000000.000","Race and Money in America, Contemporary Business Application","elective","M 4:10 PM-7:10 PM","Reed, Ebony","ebony.reed@yale.edu","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/85617/assignments/syllabus","EVANS 4430","01","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94799/assignments/syllabus","202401","2.0","1","","",""

The course will aim to convince students that “political ethics” is not an oxymoron; rather, it is a balancing of stakeholder expectations, personal beliefs and an organization’s mission-driven purpose. Every type of organization – for-profit and nonprofit entities, consulting and law firms, even governments themselves – must come to terms with evolving political ethics in our contentious times. The course will specifically address debates about corporate social responsibility (CSR), environmental, social and corporate governance standards (ESG) and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).  The course provides a legal practitioner’s perspective, drawing on high profile scenarios and applications of law to common scenarios.  The lecturer brings over 25 years of experience in political and election law as a national expert counseling the regulated community of leading corporations, unions, associations, nonprofits and individuals involved in the political process.

Yale students partner with mission-driven social entrepreneurs (SEs) to focus on a specific management challenge that the student/SE teams work together to address during the semester.  The course covers both theoretical and practical issues, including case studies and discussions on social enterprise, developing a theory of change and related social metrics, financing social businesses, the role of civil society, framing a consulting engagement, managing team dynamics, etc. The course is taught by Tony Sheldon, Senior Lecturer in the Practice of Management and Executive Director of SOM’s Program on Social Enterprise. The course meets on Tuesdays 4:10 – 7:10 during Spring semester. Subject to Yale and SOM travel policies, students will travel to Nairobi for 5 days of working with their partner SEs in March 2024 (the first week of spring break). As with the International Experience and the Global Network Immersion Week, students will be responsible for covering the costs of their round-trip airfare and related expenses (such as visa and immunizations). SOM students’ available GSA funds can be drawn on to offset in-country travel, hotel, and related costs.  The Jackson Institute and the School of the Environment also have funds available to offset in-country costs for their students. Enrollment is by application only.

In this course we will explore how firms can better organize their operations so that they more effectively align their supply with the demand for their products and services.

Using the Socratic case method, this course will explore several of the many ways to be an entrepreneur. MBA students frequently express interest in doing something entrepreneurial after completing their graduate degree program. Most MBA students with an interest in entrepreneurship consider only a narrow range of potential business opportunities. This course will highlight the multiple ways to become an entrepreneur.
Entrepreneurship, using HBS Professor Howard Stevenson’s definition of ”pursuing an opportunity beyond the resources controlled,” is a big tent. Although Silicon Valley technology ventures and flashy consumer products startups receive most of the attention in the media and on campus, there are other ways to jump into the entrepreneurial arena. This course explores six distinct patterns in entrepreneurship (and there might be many more), some of which fly under the radar of many MBA students. This course will not advocate any single pattern of entrepreneurship over the others; rather, the course will encourage students to discover the best potential path for themselves using a ten-step framework for analysis. 
There is no right or wrong pattern in entrepreneurship – aspiring entrepreneurs owe it to themselves to learn about and contemplate a variety of options. Then, with better information and a higher degree of confidence, they can rigorously evaluate which entrepreneurial path best suits their specific interests, needs, and goals. Additionally, aspiring entrepreneurs should factor risk and lifestyle into their decision-making process. Which form of entrepreneurship has the highest probability of success, however you define it? And which one will best accommodate the lifestyle you envision for yourself? Official and unofficial auditing is not permitted. Please see the Registrar’s Office (not the instructor) for all enrollment, registration, and auditing questions.","28896","MGT 874","spring-2","20240507 000000.000","20240325 000000.000","Patterns in Entrepreneurship","elective","M  W 10:10 AM-11:30 AM","Wasserstein, A.J.","adam.wasserstein@yale.edu","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/81789/assignments/syllabus","EVANS 4430","01","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94857/assignments/syllabus","202401","2.0","1","","",""
"bid","Operations","Service economy is expanding more than ever, not just with the growth of the services industries (conventionally defined as the third sector) but also with services’ increasing importance in non-services industries such as agriculture (the first sector) and manufacturing (the second sector). Today, driven by emergence of digital technologies and amplified by hyper-connectivity of global markets, anything and everything seems to become something as a service e.g., Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), and now Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS). Are things going too far? What does it mean for our everyday marketing, operations, HRM, and strategy? Should we now be strategizing, organizing, and leading businesses, differently, and, if so, how? 

By introducing you to Service Management, an emerging field of management science which was originally developed out of the research on the services industries but has later evolved into the study on the logic (or lens, if you will) of value creation and value capture across industries, this course attempts to help future business leaders to see ongoing fundamental shift in management logic and to seize opportunities and challenges involved in leading business in such an exciting time.","28897","MGT 875","spring-1","20240305 000000.000","20240122 000000.000","Service Management","elective","M  W 8:30 AM-9:50 AM","Fujikawa, Yoshinori","yoshinori.fujikawa@yale.edu","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/85627/assignments/syllabus","EVANS 2200","01","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94862/assignments/syllabus","202401","2.0","1","","",""

"bid","Organizational Behavior","Financial crises do not occur often, but when they do occur, they can have devastating impact on the financial system and economy.

In order to enroll in this course you must attend the first class meeting on January 25 in its entirety. Also, please note that there is a homework assignment due before the first class. Auditing is not permitted. Course description: This course will be co-taught by Jeffrey E. Garten and Robert D. Hormats, whose combined experience spans the Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, and Obama administrations, as well as decades on Wall Street. The course is based on the premise that America’s role and policies in the global economy are undergoing a profound change that will outlast the current administration in Washington. It will examine the major forces in the U.S. and abroad that will be determining America’s future in the global economy and the likely policies it will follow for the next decade. These will include changes in the country’s industrial and financial structures, new social pressures, new demographic patterns, and evolving political alignments. Typical of the kinds of questions to be examined will be: How will the changing labor force affect America’s interest in the global arena? How will changing technology affect these interests? What about changes in energy and the environment? What will trade policy, policy toward foreign investment and immigration policy look like? How should we think about the changing roles of Wall Street, Corporate America, and Silicon Valley? Regarding developments abroad, we will ask questions such as these: How will China’s evolving interests, or new directions for the European Union, or the changing position of big emerging markets, or new pressures in global finance influence American policy, and with what effect? If the U.S. attempts to reduce its international involvement, who will write and try to enforce the “rules of the game?” Given the centrality of the United States to the global economy, the course will be important global background for future leaders in any profession.","28912","MGT 896","spring","20240507 000000.000","20240122 000000.000","America’s Future Role in the Global Economy","elective","Th 1:00 PM-4:00 PM","Garten, Jeffrey","jeffrey.garten@yale.edu","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/85639/assignments/syllabus","EVANS 2210","01","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94551/assignments/syllabus","202401","4.0","1","","",""

Broadly speaking, entrepreneurial financing decisions have a life cycle. The cycle begins with identifying opportunities, moves to marshaling resources to take advantage of these opportunities and executing the business plan, and ends with harvesting the venture's success. Accordingly, the course has three sections: Identifying and Valuing Opportunities, Structuring Deals, and Harvesting Opportunities. This course combines lectures and case studies. The lecture part will equip students with important techniques in each stage of entrepreneurial finance; those techniques are applied to case studies covering interesting entrepreneurial areas such as IT, healthcare, sharing economy, impact investment, etc.

Consumer product startups differ from tech start-ups in a myriad of ways, and therefore merit their own study. We will trace the journey of consumer product entrepreneurship from ideation, to demand estimation, launching, marketing, scaling, and exit.

Along the way we’ll study not only the companies in our cases, but also some of today’s fastest-growing consumer product companies, and why they’ve taken off so quickly. We’ll look at the ever-changing marketing landscape for consumer brands, including newer players like TikTok, Fl!p, and Moonship; and, we’ll put ourselves in the shoes of the founders’ building these brands at breakneck speeds. 

As a founder of a consumer product company myself, my hope with the course is to showcase how immensely gratifying - and deeply challenging - it is to create a product that people love, a brand that people trust, and a business model that can stand the test of time.","28916","MGT 913","spring-1","20240305 000000.000","20240122 000000.000","Entrepreneurial Ventures in Consumer Products","elective","W 2:40 PM-5:40 PM","Miller, KJ","kj.miller@yale.edu","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/85644/assignments/syllabus","EVANS 4410","01","https://yale.instructure.com/courses/94564/assignments/syllabus","202401","2.0","1","","",""

The course is structured around the “VC/PE cycle.” It starts from setting up a VC firm, fundraising from limited partners (LPs), and the contracting problem with LPs.

"bid","Economics","Venture capital and private equity play a critical role in the financing and development of high-growth entrepreneurial companies. This course takes the perspective of venture investors, and will cover the tools, methods, and mindset used by venture capitalist to operate, invest, and create value. Many of these skills and insights are readily generalizable to other PE models. The course is structured around the “VC/PE cycle.” It starts from setting up a VC firm, fundraising from limited partners (LPs), and the contracting problem with LPs. The cycle moves to selecting and valuing an entrepreneurial company and structuring a deal. We then investigate the management of investments and value creation. Finally, we study the exit of investments and the risks and returns of the PE asset class. This course combines lectures and case studies.
